BASIC Compiler Notes
====================

The `basicc` compiler accepts the `--no-line-tracking` flag to skip inserting
`basic_set_line` calls during code generation.  Disabling line tracking can
speed up compiled programs but removes support for `RESUME` without an explicit
line number and causes the `basic_get_line` helper to report an error if
invoked.

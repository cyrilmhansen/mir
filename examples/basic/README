BASIC Compiler Notes
====================

The `basicc` compiler accepts the `--no-line-tracking` flag to skip inserting
`basic_set_line` calls during code generation.  Disabling line tracking can
speed up compiled programs but removes support for `RESUME` without an explicit
line number and causes the `basic_get_line` helper to report an error if
invoked.

The REPL understands a `RUN PROFILING` command which executes the current
program with profiling enabled. After the program finishes, it prints line
statistics followed by function statistics, each sorted in ascending order. The
format lists the line number or function name, the execution count, and the
total time in seconds.

Example session:

```
10 DEF FNA(X)=X+1
20 PRINT FNA(1)
30 PRINT FNA(2)
40 END
RUN PROFILING
QUIT
```

Sample output:

```
2
3
line 20: count 1 time 0.000000001
line 30: count 1 time 0.000000001
func FNA: count 2 time 0.000000002
```

Pi Spigot Example
-----------------
The `pi_spigot.bas` program demonstrates generating digits of `PI` using only
integer arithmetic.  It builds the result as a string one digit at a time via a
spigot algorithm.

Run the sample with the BASIC compiler and provide the desired number of digits
at the prompt.  For example, supplying `20` produces 20 digits after the decimal
point:

```
DIGITS?
3.14159265358979323846
